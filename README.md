# battleship_simple
A simplified Java implementation of the battleship game. Each player has a board with six ships and two players, the first player to sink all the ships on the board wins.

Six battleships include three small battleships, two medium battleships, and one large battleship.

The program is the product of a failure inside a programming assignment and does not satisfy the documentation requirements for the assignment (two players and a board). It actually only needs some simple modifications. 

Hopefully this mistake will not be made againÔºÅ

## If you need a reference, the program is in the master branch.
